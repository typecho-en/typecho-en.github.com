					<h3>"No input files specified" Error on Godaddy shared hosting</h3>
					<p>This problem is always found on Godaddy hosting. And they are most strange hosting I have ever seen. First of all, it is because php doesn't know pathinfo parameter. Godaddy uses php-cgi mode (I think it make php4 and php5 compatible at the same time) to run php, so it makes some strange errors.</p>
					Solution:
					Find php5.ini in the root directory (Create this by yourself if you can't find it), add this following:
					<pre>cgi.fix_pathinfo = 1</pre>
				</section>

					<h3>Can't login Admin Control Panel, shows "405, method not allowed"</h3>
					<p>A Nginx inherent bug make this error. Typecho uses rewrited urls. It's not allowed to make post request to static urls before 0.7, so it does.</p>
					Solution:
					Upgrade your Nginx to 0.7 or higher
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Can't login Admin Control Panel, shows "404, not found" when you click foreground links or login Admin Control Panel</h3>
					<p>This is because Nginx configation don't support pathinfo, the details about php pathinfo can be searched on Internet.</p>
					Solution:
					Normally, the location setting of nginx.conf is also like this:
					<pre>location ~ .*\.php$</pre>
					To support pathinfo, change to this:
					<pre>location ~ .*\.php(\/.*)*$</pre>
					In some old-version php, maybe need to enable cgi.fix_pathinfo on php.ini
					<pre>cgi.fix_pathinfo = 1</pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Can't enable rewrite, it's not successful to change in Admin Control Panel</h3>
					<p>This is because rewrite on Nginx isn't configured.</p>
					Solution:
					Jump to the paragraph of server in nginx.conf, normally we suggest this following configation:
					<pre>
server {
		listen          80;
		server_name     yourdomain.com;
		root            /home/yourdomain/www/;
		index           index.html index.htm index.php;

		if (!-e $request_filename) {
			rewrite ^(.*)$ /index.php$1 last;
		}

		location ~ .*\.php(\/.*)*$ {
		include fastcgi.conf;
		fastcgi_pass  127.0.0.1:9000;
		}

		access_log logs/yourdomain.log combined;
	}
					</pre>
					<p class="caution">"Yourdomain" in the code should be replaced your domain and directory</p>
